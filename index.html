      <h3>NASA AMSR-e Soil Moisture</h1>
      <p>Surface soil moisture content (0-2cm depth) is highly correlated to surface brightness temperature, and this relationship has been utilized for creating global data products of surface soil moisture content using satellite-based radiometer instruments (Njoku et al, 2003). NASA's Aqua satellite collected surface brightness temperature at six different frequencies [6.92, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, 89.0 GHz], each with different spatial resolution. Natural atmospheric processes distort the C-band [6.925 GHz frequency, 350 MHz bandwidth], but the X-band [10.65 GHz frequency, 100 MHz bandwidth] may be used across the globe without too much interference from vegetation or atmosphere. As different bands of surface brightness are appropriate to estimate soil moisture according to land cover and atmospheric affects, the resolution of soil moisture data is 50 km on average globally.</p>
      <p>We are using the AMSR-e Level 3 surface soil moisture data product to drive a hydrologic model within a non-linear data assimilation system.  <a href="http://nsidc.org/data/ae_land3" target="_blank">AMSR-e</a> has a temporal range of 2002-2011 at a daily time-step. The Level 3 product has been screened of pixels that were contaminated by the presence of ice or excessive cloudiness or were missing from the satellite's daily pass coverage (Njoku et al, 2003). Error generated by thick vegetative cover and surface roughness within the C-band is still present in Level 3 data, but our model parameterization will account for this error during optimization. AMSR-e data is resampled to 1 km using a nearest neighbor interpolation prior to use in making U.S.-wide RZSM estimates.</p>
      <h3>North American Ecoregions</h1>
      <p>The U.S. EPA provides a map with units representing areas of similar broad-scale ecological properties, termed ecoregions.  Climate, dominant vegetation type, topography, and hydrologic regimes all inform the delineation of ecoregions (Omnerik, 1995). Climate regimes define ecoregion boundaries at the coarsest scale, while landscape vegetation patterns and topographic features define boundaries at the finest scale. Level II and III ecoregions are being used for this project.</p>
